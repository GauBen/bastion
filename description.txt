Bastion Inc. is proud to announce the immediate availability of Bastion, its secure instant messaging service! Feel free to make yourself at home and start messaging friends.

You will need to access Bastion on your phone because the desktop version is currently under development. Sorry for the inconvenience.

You will find attached the code of the frontend, because we want anyone to be able to develop an interface to their liking. However, the API code will remain closed.

(More explicitly: the frontend code does not contain any vulnerabilities, and we don't want you to waste time reverse engineering it.)
